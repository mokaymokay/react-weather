# React Weather App

This is a simple weather app created using the [Tutorial by Joan Mira](http://joanmira.com/tutorial-build-a-weather-app-with-react). It displays the weather of cities in the world by connecting to the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api).

The tutorial was created in January 2016; now, two years later, many of the dependencies are outdated and even the React syntax is deprecated, i.e. React.createClass is no longer supported as of React 15.5, I am using React 16.2.

Since this is my first experience with React, I am not sure how to rewrite the app properly. I will get back to this when I become more familiar with React.
